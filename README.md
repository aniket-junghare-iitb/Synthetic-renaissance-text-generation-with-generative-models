# Synthetic-renaissance-text-generation-with-generative-models
This repository contains my submission for the RenAIssance GSoC 2025 project, focused on generating high-quality synthetic Renaissance-style texts using generative language models. It investigates how such models can produce early modern text to enhance OCR performance and support digital restoration efforts.
