# Abstract

This project aims to generate *synthetic Renaissance-style* printed text images that authentically replicate the *visual characteristics* of *17th-century print media*. The objective is to simulate *realistic historical degradations* such as *ink bleed*, *smudging*, *fading*, and *printing inconsistencies*, enabling the creation of enriched datasets for training and evaluating *document restoration*, *OCR*, and *historical text analysis* models. By blending *historical aesthetics* with *modern generative techniques*, this work supports advancements in *digital humanities* and the preservation of *early modern printed culture*.
